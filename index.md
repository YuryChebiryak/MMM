### The Idea

>The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.
> -- H. P. Lovecraft

We are gamers and big fans of Lovecraft, and could never find an RPG game with a vast world like in *Fallout* but with some horror elements but not limited to them like *The Forest*. One could say it's a game brought to you from fellow games, we have been influenced by *Diablo*, *GTA*, *Skyrim* and TODO.
