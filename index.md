### The Idea

>The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.
> -- H. P. Lovecraft

We are gamers and big fans of Lovecraft, and could never find an RPG game with a vast world like in *Fallout* but with some horror elements but not limited to them like *The Forest*. One could say it's a game brought to you from fellow games, we have been influenced by *Diablo*, *GTA*, *Skyrim* and TODO. 

### Why "MMM"?

It all started with a meteorite hitting the Earth. All by itself it didn't cause a huge catastrophe: just few acres of poor old farmer Jack were damaged... but soon things began to change... strange glowing of plants at night... them growing... abundantly... then animals... morphed... into something unnamed... what's next?.. maybe the change is already in you?..

### What is Open World

TODO Stefan in details: absense of loading screens

### Why Crowdfunding?

We were working on the game in a small team of developers for over three years now and were planning to launch the game without involving venture capital or taking a credit. But few months ago our budget intially formed by winning during cryptocurrencies rally dwindled down and we met a decision of starting a KickStarter campaign.
