## The Idea

> The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.
>
> -- H. P. Lovecraft

We are gamers and big fans of Lovecraft, and could never find an RPG game with a vast world like in **Fallout** but with some horror elements but not limited to them like **The Forest**. One could say it's a game brought to you from fellow games, we have been influenced by **Diablo**, **GTA**, **Skyrim** and TODO STEFAN WHAT ELSE HAS INSPIRED YOU. Some guys on the dev team are gamers since ZX Spectrum era (**Nether Earth** and **Elite** 1984 being their first games played) and upon release you can expect this game to be a wild mixture of genres with unique mechanics, game actions and atmosphere.

### Why "MMM"?

It all started with a meteorite hitting the Earth. All by itself it didn't cause a huge catastrophe: just few acres of poor old farmer Jack were damaged... but soon things began to change... strange glowing of plants at night... them growing... abundantly... then animals... morphed... into something unnamed... what's next?.. maybe the change is already in you?..

### What is Open World

TODO Stefan in details: absense of loading screens

## Why Crowdfunding?

We were working on the game in a small team of developers for over three years now and were planning to launch the game without involving venture capital or taking a credit. But few months ago our budget intially formed by winning during cryptocurrencies rally dwindled down and we met a decision of starting a KickStarter campaign.

### Support from community

We have invested a lot of effort and money into the quality of the game, leaving no time or effort  for marketing.

This is a very different approach to most traditional game development studios which invest a considerable amount of effort, time and money into marketing the product. Through the approach which built "title" the highest quality of gameplay experience is targeted, so please tell your friends about the game, **THE GAME NEEDS YOU** to get financed and achieve the quality it strives for and deliver very quickly **WITHOUT LOSING TIME FOR ADVERTISING**. Your support means a lot to us, so please like, share, subscribe, and tell your friends about this game if you like the idea.
